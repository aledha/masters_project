# masters-project
This is the repository for my master's thesis on numerical modelling of cardiac electro-mechanics.
See src/monodomain.py for an electrophysiology solver, src/hyperelasticity.py for a mechanics solver, and src/coupled_model.py for an electro-mechanics solver.
demos_mech/ contains some demos for the mechanics solvers, while demos_coupling contain a demo for a coupled solver.

My supervisor organization is Simula Research Laboratories, and my supervisors are
* Henrik Finsberg
* JÃ¸rgen Dokken
* Joakim Sundnes
